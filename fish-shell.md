```fish
#!/usr/bin/env fish

echo 'Hello from Fish!'
```

```fish
# my comment
```

```fish
echo 'Hello from Fish!'
# or
printf '%s\n' 'Hello from Fish!'
```

### Reading from stdin

```fish
read my_variable
```

### Loops

```fish
for i in (seq 1 10)
  ...
end
```

## Variables

### Defining and erasing

```fish
# Declare the global/local variable:
set my_variable 'Hello from Fish!'

i# Remove the variable:
set --erase my_variable
```

### Slicing

```fish
echo $my_variable[1..10]
echo $my_variable[2..]
echo $my_variable[..-2]
```

## Numbers

### Incrementing and decrementing

```fish
set my_variable (math $my_variable + 1)
set my_variable (math $my_variable - 1)
```

### Arithmetic

```fish
echo (math 1 + 2)
```

string match --regex --entire 'Fish' 'Hello from Fish!'
```

| Pattern             | Matches                   |
| ---                 | ---                       |
| `x?`                | Zero or one `x` chars     |
| `x*`                | Any count `x` chars       |
| `x+`                | One or more  `x` chars    |
| `x{n}`              | n times `x` chars         |
| `x{n,m}`            | n to m times `x` chars    |
| `x{n,}`             | n or more times `x` chars |
| `[xy]`              | `x` or y char             |
| `[^xy]`             | not `x` or y char         |
| ---                 | ---                 |
| `\w`                | Word character      |
| `\d`                | Digit character     |
| `\W`                | Not word character  |
| `\D`                | Not digit character |

Perl compatible regular expressions are described here.

### Replacing

```fish
# Replaces the first match
string replace --regex 'Fish' 'fish' 'Hello from Fish!'

# Replaces all matches
string replace --regex --all 'Fish' 'fish' 'Hello from Fish!'
```

## Conditionals

### If/else

```fish
if test $my_variable -lt $another_variable
  ···
else if test $my_variable -eq $another_variable
  ···
else
  ···
end
```
