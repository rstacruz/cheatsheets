### General workflow

* Start a flynn cluster (on amazon or vagrant)
* `flynn cluster add` to add that cluster
* `flynn create NAME` in your app
* `git push flynn master` to deploy

### Creating a cluster (AWS)

```bash
flynn install  # (provisions AWS EC2 stuff)
flynn key add  # (adds your pubkey to AWS)
```

#### What it does

* This creates `XXXX.flynnhub.com`
* Dashboard in `dashboard.XXXX.flynnhub.com`
* Use `flynn -a dashboard env get LOGIN_TOKEN` to get login token
* Apps live in `APP.XXXX.flynnhub.com`

### Using a flynn cluster

Managed in `~/.flynnrc`:
{: .-setup}

```bash
flynn cluster
flynn cluster add [-g githost] [-p pin] NAME URL KEY
flynn cluster remove NAME
flynn cluster default NAME # use this current
```

### Setting up a new app

```bash
cd ~/project
flynn create example # adds the `flynn` remote
flynn route # prints http routes
git push flynn master
```

## Commands

### Environment vars

```bash
flynn env
flynn env set FOO=bar BAZ=foobar
flynn env unset FOO
```

### Scale

```bash
flynn ps
flynn scale web=3
```

### Logs

```bash
flynn log
flynn log flynn-d55c7a...
```

### Running commands

```bash
flynn run rake db:migrate
```

### Manage routes
