## Resources

### Multiple resources (`resources`)

    resources :photos

    # PhotosController:
    # index  =>    GET /photos
    # new    =>    GET /photos/new
    # create =>   POST /photos/new
    # show   =>    GET /photos/:id
    # edit   =>    GET /photos/:id/edit
    # update =>    PUT /photos/:id
    # delete => DELETE /photos/:id
    #
    # Helpers:
    # new_photo_path
    # photo_path(id)
    # edit_photo_path(id)

### Custom actions

    resources :photos do
      member { get 'preview' }       # /photo/1/preview
      collection { get 'search' }    # /photos/search

      get 'preview', on: :member     # (..same as the first)
    end

### Options

    resources :photos,
      path_names: { new: 'brand_new' }    # /photos/1/brand_new
      path: 'postings'                    # /postings
      only: :index
      only: [:index, :show]
      except: :show
      except: [:index, :show]

      shallow: true                       # also generate shallow routes
      shalow_path: 'secret'
      shallow_prefix: 'secret'

## Single resource (`resource`)

    resource :coder

    # CodersController:
    # new    =>    GET /coder/new
    # create =>   POST /coder/new
    # show   =>    GET /coder
    # edit   =>    GET /coder/edit
    # update =>    PUT /coder
    # delete => DELETE /coder

## Matching (`match`)

    match 'photo/:id' => 'photos#show'  # /photo/what-is-it
    match 'photo/:id', id: /[0-9]+/     # /photo/0192
    match 'photo/:id' => 'photos#show', constraints: { id: /[0-9]+/ }
    match 'photo/:id', via: :get
    match 'photo/:id', via: [:get, :post]

    match 'photo/*path' => 'photos#unknown'    # /photo/what/ever

    # params[:format] == 'jpg'
    match 'photos/:id' => 'photos#show', :defaults => { :format => 'jpg' }

### Get/post

`get` is the same as `match via: :get`.

    get 'photo/:id' => 'photos#show'
    # same as match 'photo/:id' => 'photos#show', via: :get

    post 'photo/:id' => 'photos#update'
    # same as match 'photo/:id' => 'photos#show', via: :post

### Redirection

    match '/stories' => redirect('/posts')
    match '/stories/:name' => redirect('/posts/%{name}')

### Named

    # logout_path
    match 'exit' => 'sessions#destroy', as: :logout
    
### Constraints

    match '/', constraints: { subdomain: 'admin' }

    # admin.site.com/admin/photos
    namespace 'admin' do
      constraints subdomain: 'admin' do
        resources :photos
      end
    end

### Custom constraints

    class BlacklistConstraint
      def initialize
        @ips = Blacklist.retrieve_ips
      end
     
      def matches?(request)
        @ips.include?(request.remote_ip)
      end
    end
     
    TwitterClone::Application.routes.draw do
      match "*path" => "blacklist#index",
        :constraints => BlacklistConstraint.new
    end

### Scopes

    scope 'admin', constraints: { subdomain: 'admin' } do
      resources ...
    end

### Rack middleware

    # Yes, Sprockets is middleware
    match '/application.js' => Sprockets

### Route helpers

    projects_path   # /projects
    projects_url    # http://site.com/projects


### Default help text

    # The priority is based upon order of creation:
    # first created -> highest priority.

    # Sample of regular route:
    match 'products/:id' => 'catalog#view'

    # Keep in mind you can assign values other than :controller and :action

    # Sample of named route:
    match 'products/:id/purchase' => 'catalog#purchase', :as => :purchase

    # This route can be invoked with purchase_url(:id => product.id)

    # Sample resource route (maps HTTP verbs to controller actions automatically):
    resources :products

    # Sample resource route with options:
    resources :products do
      member do
        get 'short'
        post 'toggle'
      end
    
      collection do
        get 'sold'
      end
    end

    # Sample resource route with sub-resources:
    resources :products do
      resources :comments, :sales
      resource :seller
    end

    # Sample resource route with more complex sub-resources
    resources :products do
      resources :comments
      resources :sales do
        get 'recent', :on => :collection
      end
    end

    # Sample resource route within a namespace:
    namespace :admin do
      # Directs /admin/products/* to Admin::ProductsController
      # (app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb)
      resources :products
    end

    # You can have the root of your site routed with "root"
    # just remember to delete public/index.html.
    root :to => 'welcome#index'

    # See how all your routes lay out with "rake routes"

    # This is a legacy wild controller route that's not recommended for RESTful applications.
    # Note: This route will make all actions in every controller accessible via GET requests.
    match ':controller(/:action(/:id(.:format)))'
